This project is extended by me for testing purposes.

Unit, Integration & E2E testing has been implemented using react-testing-library & cypress with cypress-testing-library.

**Steps to run project locally**
- run ```yarn install && yarn dev```
- Project will open at port 3000 & backend will be running on 3001

**To run integation testing (jest)**
- run ```yarn run test```

**To run end2end testing (cypress)**
- run ```yarn run cypress open```
- a window/app will open with option of 'E2E' test. click on it and you will see 'payment_spec' test. Double click to run it.
